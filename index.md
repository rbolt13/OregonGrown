## Introduction

On March 23, 2020 Oregon Governor Kate Brown ordered Oregonians to [“Stay Home, Save Lives”](https://govstatus.egov.com/or-stay-home-save-lives). An order that initially included the closure of non-essential businesses, and imposed social distancing, that is still impacting the state nine months later on the verge of entering the new year, 2021. 

### COVID Closures

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rbolt13/OregonGrown/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rbolt13/OregonGrown/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
