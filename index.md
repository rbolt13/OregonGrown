## Introduction

On March 23, 2020 Oregon Governor Kate Brown ordered Oregonians to [“Stay Home, Save Lives”](https://govstatus.egov.com/or-stay-home-save-lives). An order that initially included the closure of non-essential businesses, imposed social distancing, encouraged face masks, and is still impacting the state nine months later as businesses continue to alter their business models just to stay afloat. A once thriving industry in Portland, now sees more closures, both permanent and temporary, than any other industry that has been negatively impacted by COVID-19, according to [Yelp](https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/business-closures-update-sep-2020.html) . Entering 2021, usually Oregon's slowest business quarter due to the cold weather, frequent rain, and increase in snow storms over the past decade, many Oregonians, especially those who lost their non-essential service industry jobs, are anxiously anticipating what will become of Portland’s restaurant landscape in 2021. 

### History and COVID Closures 2020

When this project began, late fall 2020, it was so as a means to visually display restaurant closures in Portland due to the COVID-19. To collect data we initially contacted the Oregon Restaurant and Lodging Association (ORLA) and different staff members from Eater. With no response from Eater yet, the ORLA graciously replied back to my emails. Initially they didn’t have any data to use, but shared a PDF , ‘COVID-19 Restaurant Impact Survey - December 2020’ shown below.

While this pdf began turning the wheels of what this project could potentially be, the closures project continued on using this [Eater](https://pdx.eater.com/2020/5/5/21248144/permanent-closures-covid-19-coronavirus) article as the main data set. With help from Krishna Sunglieng and a couple other members of the PCC G.I.S. Club we began to collect dates completely socially distanced, never having met in person during a global pandemic. Working in this manor brought up its own set of issues, that was especially apparent during [Executive Order 20-65 (4a1)](https://www.oregon.gov/gov/admin/Pages/eo_20-65.aspx), also know to Portlanders as the 2 week freeze that shut down all inside and outside consumption. This raised  two questions:

1. Are we only reporting permanent closures or both permanent and temporary closures? 
2. How do we collect and maintain accurate up to date data on temporary closures? 

With little response from the larger group, Krishna thought it best, and I agreed, to begin only looking at permanent closures.  As I continued my research on the months of closure and the premanatality of closures, a two more questions arose for me:

3. Should we track restaurants that opened (where one previously closed) during the pandemic? 
4. Should we track the ‘type’ of restaurants that were both closing and opening. 

According to the same [Yelp](https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/business-closures-update-sep-2020.html)  article from above, in September 2020 Breakfast and Brunch spots were struggling the hardest, which was an interesting contrast to the types of retail-esqu carry out business model I was seeing opening up in places where restaurants had previously closed. While another page was added to track restaurants opening, the type was still left out as members of the group still hadn’t completed (or even touched) their portion of the Permanent Closure data. While Krishna began playing around with potential map layouts and symbology I couldn’t help but feel as though the resistance to input data was mainly due to a lack of understanding of what was actually going on in the restaurant industry.
